*-* Designed, managed and led a $1 million research project that developed and applied advanced analytics to combine big data with existing trial data, biophysical and economic models and better predict effects of management on crop yield, profit and sustainability.
* Increased investment in research and development in WA by designing, scoping, participating in or providing leadership to 6 externally funded collaborative research projects.
* Increased WA’s capability and capacity in big data analytics for agriculture by:
−	Supervision of 1 postdoctoral researcher and 2 PhD students at Murdoch University.
−	Mentoring, coaching or leading new and existing researchers from industry (3 companies), state government (2 researchers) and Curtin University (4 data analysts/postdoctoral researchers and 1 PhD student).
−	Participation in unfunded collaborative research projects with industry (1), state government (3) and Curtin University (2). 
−	Industry consultation.
* Strengthened WA’s national and international research standing by establishing national and international collaborative research links, publishing in high quality, peer-reviewed journals and presenting at national and international conferences.
* Prepared comprehensive annual reports. 

Core research:
* Developed new methods for spatial yield mapping and prediction using satellite imagery, climate data, crop models and machine learning.
* Developed new methods for forecasting yield potential using historical yield maps and climate data for use in predicting outcomes of management decisions.
* Developed new methods for analysing and visualising data from large on-farm experiments to understand spatial variation in crop response to treatments.
* Combined weather data, crop growth and economic models to understand, forecast and map risk of foliar fungal crop disease.

Collaborative research projects:
* Food Agility CRC Data-driven grain profitability through “On-Farm Experimentation”. 
Led the development and application of new analytics and visualisations for data from large on-farm experiments. Collaborated with industry partner to develop a web tool to deliver analytics to end users.
* GRDC PROC-9715173 Nutrient Re-distribution in Ameliorated Soils. 
Led development of analytic methods and spatially varying models of crop response to fertiliser using data from large-scale experiments.
* GRDC PROC-9175172 Increasing profit from N, P and K fertiliser inputs into the evolving cropping sequences in the Western Region. 
Re-coded a process model simulating nitrogen movement in soil and plant uptake so it could be used in a simulation study that demonstrated grain growers in WA need not change nitrogen rates unless seasonal conditions cause changes in potential yield of 1 t ha-1 or more.
* COGGO Should Western Australia be worried about weak wheat? 
Used big data to identify thresholds of temperature and humidity that indicate risk of pre-harvest sprouting of wheat.
* RIRDC Improved use of seasonal forecasting to increase farmer profitability. 
Enabled provision of timely seasonal climate information to support farm business decisions and improve productivity and profitability.
* GRDC DAW00236 Soil acidity is limiting grain yield. 
Developed a mobile app that incorporates a process model of the dynamics of soil acidification to help grain growers and their consultants understand the long-term economic benefits of liming.
