<p><i>What would you do if your perfect life collapsed?</i></p>
<p>Lee’s perfect life unravels fast. The man she planned to be with forever dumps her and a humiliating clash with her new boss forces her to quit her dream job. Desperate to find a new life purpose, she makes a brave, rash decision to hike the Bibbulmun Track—a thousand-kilometre walking trail through the south-west of Western Australia. Her brand-new boots carry her along a wind-swept coastline and through ancient forests, but ultimately Lee is on a journey to self-discovery.</p>
