<i>What would you do if your perfect life collapsed?</i>


Leeâ€™s boyfriend dumps her and her new boss makes life miserable, so she quits. Desperate to find a new purpose in life, she decides to hike the Bibbulmun Track, a thousand kilometre walking trail through the south-west of Western Australia. Her brand-new boots carry her along a wind-swept coastline and through ancient forests, but ultimately Lee is on a journey to self-discovery.
