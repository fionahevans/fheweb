<p>The melody was familiar. How did the words go? Brown sugar. A good choice. I snatch up the phone.</p>
<p>“Do you have it?”</p>
<p>“Twice your usual. Like you wanted.”</p>
<p>I race downstairs and into the street. He slumps against the alley wall, away from the glare of streetlights.</p>
<p>A flash of a smile as I hand him the cash.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you next week,” he says before striding into the darkness.
But he won’t.</p>
<p>Upstairs, I find a limpid vein purpled against greying flesh.</p>
<p>Squeeze. Pat. Jab. Release.</p>
<p>I sigh. It’s done. Now I just have to wait.</p>
<p>It starts slowly.Tension eases and muscles relax. Her eyes open and she sits up, leans forward and wraps her arms around me.</p>
<p>“My good boy. My dear son.”</p>
<p>I smooth her hair and stroke her face. Avoid looking at the mass distending her night gown.</p>
<p>“How do you feel?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Better.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Mum. It will be over soon.”</p>
