<p>Marie takes a sip of her cocktail. She twirls the paper umbrella and glances across the table.</p>
<p>“Am I supposed to be scared now?”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying that.”</p>
<p>He reaches over and grasps her hand.</p>
<p>“No, really,” he says. “There’s nothing to be scared of.”</p>
<p>He straightens up and looks back at the entrance to the restaurant. He seems to be looking for something or someone. His hand feels clammy in hers.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why I let you talk me into this,” she says. “I work in a morgue. I’ve seen more dead bodies than you can imagine. I’ve seen real monsters, Michael.”</p>
<p>She looks up with a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen real monsters and they’re nothing like you.”</p>
<p>He leans over the table, his eyes searching hers.</p>
<p>“I’m not a monster, Marie. I’m just a man.”</p>
<p>Marie tears her hand away and clasps it between her thighs.</p>
<p>“Not a monster, just a man who wants to do monstrous things,” she says.</p>
<p>“You can’t pull out now, you took my deposit. Let’s go over the plan one more time.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Marie pouts. “Next new moon, I lock up as usual, but I put the spare key under the rock.”</p>
<p>“The reddish-coloured rock, under the Mr Lincoln.”</p>
<p>“The what?”</p>
<p>“The rose bush, with the crimson flowers.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, right. I put the key under the reddish rock under the red roses.”</p>
<p>“You go home, but come back at midnight.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know why it has to be so late.”</p>
<p>“We have to wait until it is completely dark. No one can know, especially not her family. They must
think she’s cremated, and they can’t know about me.”</p>
<p>“Because they think you’re dead.”</p>
<p>“Everyone thinks I’m dead already.” He pauses. “What do you do next?”</p>
<p>Marie finishes her drink with a slurp, rubs her finger around the inside of the glass and sucks it dry.</p>
<p>“Then I help you get the body out of the freezer.”</p>
<p>“She has a name, Marie. It’s Ashley. We lift Ashley out of the freezer”</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>“We dress her. I brought a dress. It was her favourite.”</p>
<p>Michael hands Marie a dress. The deep blue fabric is splashed with yellow flowers bright as the sunshine
outside.</p>
<p>“Sunflowers?”</p>
<p>“She said they reminded her that every morning is the start of a new day.”</p>
<p>Marie is bored. She signals the waiter and orders another cocktail.</p>
<p>“And then you’ll bury her.”</p>
<p>“It has to be in the right place. You know the place?”</p>
<p>“At the back of the cemetery, the empty part, under the ash tree.”</p>
<p>A man wearing a dark suit enters the restaurant. Michael beckons him, flashes a bank receipt and pockets
the bundle the man passes over. It smells oily and rank, like day-old perfume on an unwashed body. Marie
feels a sudden urge to leave.</p>
<p>Michael turns to her and asks one last time, “You understand, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“She’ll rise at dawn, but she’ll be hungry.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you can’t stay.”</p>
<p>“It will never work, you know.”</p>
<p>Michael rubs at the patch of rotting flesh just inside his collar.</p>
<p>“Oh, I think it will. I just don’t know how long it will last.”</p>
