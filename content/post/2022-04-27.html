<p>Days of bursting ripeness <br>
breasts swollen and aching <br>
wondering how it might feel <br>
to be swollen with child <br>
yearning to surrender solitude <br>
and be drowned in love <br>
devoted and selfless.</p>
<p>Then waking normal again <br>
slim and whole and vibrant <br>
in the calm after the storm <br>
when pain washes away <br>
lost dreams of motherhood <br>
and hormonal regrets <br>
in a red torrent of <br>
wasted blood.</p>
