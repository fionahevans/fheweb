<b>Domestic bliss</b>

The sickly sweet aroma of singed flesh tickles my nostrils as he tests the heat with his finger.

“See how hot it is?”

With smouldering eyes, he brandishes the tool at my naked curves draped across the bed.

I’m quivering with arousal and fear. Will he actually do it?

I watch, wide-eyed, as his jaw clenches and a muscle in his cheek twitches. I can almost taste the salty sheen of his sweat.

“Please,” I beg.

My husband lowers the iron, and with a gentleness I’ve never seen before, he presses the wrinkles from my new business shirt.
