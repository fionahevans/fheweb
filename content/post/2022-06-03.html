<p>My entry the WA Writing Love to Read Local Flash Fiction Competition is <a href="https://ltrl.writingwa.org/flash-fiction-competition-entries/page/8/#book1603">online</a>.</p>
<p><b>Domestic bliss</b></p>
<p>The sickly sweet aroma of singed flesh tickles my nostrils as he tests the heat with his finger.</p>
<p>“See how hot it is?”</p>
<p>With smouldering eyes, he brandishes the tool at my naked curves draped across the bed.</p>
<p>I’m quivering with arousal and fear. Will he actually do it?</p>
<p>I watch, wide-eyed, as his jaw clenches and a muscle in his cheek twitches. I can almost taste the salty sheen of his sweat.</p>
<p>“Please,” I beg.</p>
<p>My husband lowers the iron, and with a gentleness I’ve never seen before, he presses the wrinkles from my new business shirt.</p>
