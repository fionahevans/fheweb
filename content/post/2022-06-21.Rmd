I created my Twitter profile to enter a competition run by Ben Warden as @FlashSerious. I entered two Twitter-length stories with the hashtag #SFFiction and was over the moon when I was announced as one of the winners on 25 April 2022. You can read my winning story on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FionaHEvans/status/1501787496426131456).
