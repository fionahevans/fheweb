<p>Nanoism is a twitterzine, an online publication for Twitter fiction: stories with a maximum of 140 characters (conforming to the original inherent limitations of the Twitter service).</p>
<p>My nanofiction compressed a longer piece, first written during an afternoon of creativity at my house, with my dear friends Gillian and Michelle.</p>
<p>Read it at <a href="https://nanoism.net/stories/959/">Nanoism</a>.</p>

<p>I love that 140 characters captures most of the original story that aimed to include the words: liquid, scratch, panicky, caption and wealth.</p>
<p>Here’s the original, unedited:
<i>
Wendy is feeling panicky. She pulls up her sleeve and scratches the crepey skin underneath. The pumpkin that was perfectly ripe yesterday is rotting with liquid oozing from inside and dripping into the fridge. She doesn’t have time to wipe it up, let alone drive to the supermarket for another pumpkin. Her guests are arriving in under an hour, and she’ll have to make something other than the soup she’d planned.</p>
<p>Now her hands are shaking. There is nothing in the pantry, only some rice and a few onions from the garden that grew a wealth of vegetables last year but is bare now after months of drought. What will they think if they arrive and there’s nothing to eat? When they last visited, her son and daughter-in-law were already talking about the Sunnyside retirement home. Wendy crumples the brochure into a ball and stuffs it in the bin.</p>
