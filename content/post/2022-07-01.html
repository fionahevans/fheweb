<p>I penned the first draft of ‘Darkside’ as part of my homework for a short story course presented by Maria Bonar from the <a href="https://www.swwofwa.com.au/whats-on.html">Society of Women’s Writers Western Australia</a>.</p>
<p>The prompt was to write a story set in a mortuary. Normally more character-driven, I enjoyed the focus on setting although my writing style jumps around a little as I move between setting description and character-driven action. Nevertheless, I love the story and think it has a certain charm to it.</p>
<p>I was enormously pleased that it was accepted for publication in the very first edition of <a href="https://www.hauntedwordspress.com/home">Haunted Words Press</a>, a new digital literary zine focusing on tales of the gothic, the peculiar, and the downright spooky for middle grade and young adults.</p>
