I love this little story published today on [50-Word Stories](https://fiftywordstories.com/2022/08/01/fiona-h-evans-a-murder-on-the-wing/). 

I've been writing a daily story on Twitter using prompts from [\@vssdaily](https://twitter.com/vssdaily). Since 15 May 2022, I've written 79 very short stories. Every day, I'm surprised and amazed when another idea pops into my head. Funnily, the prompt that inspired _A murder on the wing_ was <font style="color: #990000">#hilltop</font>.
