<p>I love this little story published today on <a href="https://fiftywordstories.com/2022/08/01/fiona-h-evans-a-murder-on-the-wing/">50-Word Stories</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing a daily story on Twitter using prompts from <font style="color: #990000"><span class="citation">@vssdaily</span></font>. Since 15 May 2022, I’ve written 77 very short stories. Every day, I’m surprised and amazed when another idea pops into my head. Funnily, the prompt that inspired <em>A murder on the wing</em> was <font style="color: #990000">#hilltop</font>.</p>
