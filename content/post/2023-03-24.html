<p>I’ve been trying to submit at least one story a month, and I submitted “Suffocation” to 50-Word Stories
on the 3rd of March. I’d forgotten and was messing around editing it, got distracted and
started browsing 50-Word Stories - there are such fabulous stories there and all in only 50 words!</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I found that <a href="http://fiftywordstories.com/2023/03/14/fiona-h-evans-suffocation/">Suffocation</a> had been published!</p>
<p>I’m going to put my new version here as I think it’s better. It also has a new name that is more
hopeful.</p>
<div id="awakening" class="section level2">
<h2>Awakening</h2>
<p>You wipe your tears and vow he will never hurt you again. Stuff toys in a bag, tuck the baby under your arm, plead with the car to start quietly. Driving into the glow of a new dawn, you don’t notice the moment when darkness lifts and you breathe again.</p>
