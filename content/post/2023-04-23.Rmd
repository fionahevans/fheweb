I've just returned home from a wonderful Writers' Retreat run by the [Society of Women Writers 
Western Australia] (https://www.swwofwa.com.au/). I've been a member for some years now, and 
this is the third retreat that I've been on. We stayed at th St. John of God Retreat Centre 
which sits within serene gardens that are home to a labyrinth and reflection water wall. 
All of our meals were catered and we had nothing to do but learn, write, commune and be at peace.
