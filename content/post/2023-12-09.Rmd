It's a little while since this was published but I remain delighted to be included with
so many delightful and thought-provoking haiku in the [Fourth Australian Haiku Anthology](https://shop.fortysouth.com.au/products/under-the-same-moon-fourth-australian-haiku-anthology-eds-lyn-reeves-vanessa-proctor-rob-scott). It's been sitting on my bedside table for some time and I've never regretted
picking it up and opening a page at random.
