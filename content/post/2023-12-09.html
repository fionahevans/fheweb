<p>It’s a little while since this was published but I remain delighted to be included with
so many delightful and thought-provoking haiku in the <a href="https://shop.fortysouth.com.au/products/under-the-same-moon-fourth-australian-haiku-anthology-eds-lyn-reeves-vanessa-proctor-rob-scott">Fourth Australian Haiku Anthology</a>. It’s been sitting on my bedside table for some time and I’ve never regretted
picking it up and opening a page at random.</p>
