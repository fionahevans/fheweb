<p>It’s a little while since this was published but I remain delighted to be included with
so many delightful and thought-provoking haiku in the [Fourth Australian Haiku Anthology] (<a href="https://shop.fortysouth.com.au/products/under-the-same-moon-fourth-australian-haiku-anthology-eds-lyn-reeves-vanessa-proctor-rob-scott" class="uri">https://shop.fortysouth.com.au/products/under-the-same-moon-fourth-australian-haiku-anthology-eds-lyn-reeves-vanessa-proctor-rob-scott</a>). It’s been sitting on my bedside table for some time and I’ve never regretted
picking it up and opening a page at random.</p>
<p>I’ve since had another of my favourite haiku accepted for publication in
<a href="https://echidnatracks.com/">Echidna Tracks Issue 12</a> which I am looking forward to reading as
a whole.</p>
