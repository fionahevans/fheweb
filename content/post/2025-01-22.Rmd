Duck & Dash Poetry recently ran an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1475561316458730"> Anti Haiku competition</a>. The rules were simple:

<ul>
<li>Maximum 5 entries per person</li>
<li>Poets in WA only</li>
<li>Anti Haiku must be the authorâ€™s original and unpublished work ONLY</li>
<li>Work should be appropriate to share in a public forum</li>
<li>Each Anti Haiku poem must be 1-6 lines long (including title and any spaces between lines)</li>
<li>Each Anti Haiku poem must have a maximum of 40 total counts of both syllables and punctuations</li>
</ul>

Poet's were encouraged to interpret haiku and anti haiku as they liked, picking and choosing which haiku aesthetics to keep or reject. 

While I did not win, one of my entries was selected to be featured in Duck & Dash social media:

This was written during the Haku Down Under conference which was held in the middle of winter last year. The conference was online and run from New Zealand, so I set my alarm to rise early each morning. I wrote it as one line, as it can be split in multiple ways and I wanted the reader to be able to play with the words.
