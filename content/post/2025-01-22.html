<p>This was written during the Haku Down Under conference which was held in the middle of winter last year. The conference was online and run from New Zealand, so I set my alarm to rise early each morning. I wrote it as one line, as it can be split in multiple ways and I wanted the reader to be able to play with the words.</p>
