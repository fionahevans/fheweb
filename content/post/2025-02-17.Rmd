I received an email from Tim at 50-Word Stories today, saying that Duplicity has won the story of the month and I will receive the CAD$10 prize. 

The Story of the Month is chosen from the  <a href="https://fiftywordstories.com/2025/02/17/story-of-the-month-january-2025/">Story of the Week winners</a> announced from the past month.

I am so pleased and excited to become a prize-winning writer! Moreover, this is the first payment I'll take for my creative writing. While, I was paid USD$1 for my nanoism story <a href = "https://nanoism.net/stories/959/">Wendy</a>, I donated it back to the zine ðŸ˜‰.
