<i>What would you do if your perfect life collapsed?</i>


Lee’s perfect life unravels fast. The man she planned to be with forever dumps her and a 
humiliating clash with her new boss forces her to quit her dream job. Desperate to find 
a new life purpose, she makes a brave, rash decision to hike the Bibbulmun Track—a 
thousand-kilometre walking trail through the south-west of Western Australia. Her 
brand-new boots carry her along a wind-swept coastline and through ancient forests, 
but ultimately Lee is on a journey to self-discovery.

This warm, character‑driven novel explores family, human connection, and the surprising 
ways that nature teaches us who we are. It pays tribute to the changing beauty of the 
Western Australian landscape, its flora and fauna, the diverse characters who live in 
and visit the area, and the language, culture and history of the Noongar people 
who are the traditional custodians of this country.
